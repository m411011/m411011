Generally, renewing or rolling over a payday loan means that you pay a fee to delay paying back the loan. This fee does not reduce the amount you owe. You will still owe the principal and additional fees for the rollover.

Some payday lenders give borrowers the option to renew or rollover their loans if they can’t afford to pay off the loan when it’s due. However, many states limit or ban these renewals or rollovers.

If your loan is renewed or rolled over instead of being repaid in full on its due date, you are paying a fee to extend the loan due date. Renewing by paying just the fees does not reduce the principal amount you owe.

For example, on a typical payday loan, if you borrowed $300, you may owe $345 in 14 days – $300 plus the $45 interest or finance charge. If you roll over the loan and pay only the $45 interest, you have to repay the $300 plus another $45 charge 14 days later. That means the cost of the original $300 loan, due to the rollover, has gone from $45 to $90. If you roll over the loan multiple times, you may pay several hundred dollars in fees and still owe the amount you borrowed.
